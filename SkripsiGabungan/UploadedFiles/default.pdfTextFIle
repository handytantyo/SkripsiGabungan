                     Abstract: The determining of financial soundness of SOEs *DEMO*y is regulated by the government through
                       Decree of the Minister of SOEs KEP: 100 / BUMN / 2002. There are 8 parameters to be calculated for determining
                       financial soundness such as ROE, ROI, cash ratio, current ratio, collection periods, inventory *DEMO*er, TATO, and
                       ratio of total equity to total assets. From the calculation results based on these rules, there are 3 categories of
                       companies, that is *DEMO*y, less healthy and unhealthy. To *DEMO*ate the best parameters as a significant aspect to
                       *DEMO*ining financial soundness, this research using neural networks method. In this paper, it compares the value
                      of accuracy and learning rate with Artificial Neural Network and Fuzzy Neural Network method. Accuracy used
                       as the fitness value of the Genetic *DEMO*thm, to get the top three parameters from eight parameters to determining
                       the financial soundness of SOEs companies. The result of this research both ANN and FNN get the same top three
                       parameters: ROE, ROI, and Cash Ratio. In overall, artificial neural network or fuzzy neural network algorithm both
                       suitable for use in the financial health analysis of SOEs companies.

               Cash Ratio 
                        Sometimes analysts need to see the company's
                liquidity from a very conservative point of view. For
              example,  a  company  may  have  *DEMO*teed  its
                receivables and inventory, or the analyst suspects a
               severe   liquidity   problem   with   inventories   and

                         The company's best short-term liquidity is cash
                ratio.  Cash  ratio  shows  the  direct  *DEMO*ity  of  the
             company. If the company's cash ratio is too low, it
                indicates that the company has a direct problem with
                paying the bills. 
                Current Ratio 
                        Current Ratio is the ratio most commonly used
                to analyze the working capital position of a company.
                This ratio is the ratio between *DEMO*t assets with current
                liabilities. 
                Collection Periods 
                        Collection Periods is a ratio that shows how
